Notes - 9
-------------------------
- **MOND** is used to transfer measurements or readings from instruments or geoenvironmental monitoring equipment. Geoenvironmental sampling (and laboratory testing (should be included in the SAMP/ERES groups).
- This group covers the scope of data included in AGS3 within groups MONR and ICCT.
- **MOND_TYPE** defines the reading but not the instrument type nor units (which are defined by :ref:`MONG <ags4_group_MONG>` and **MOND_UNIT** respectively). Examples of **MOND_TYPE** abbreviations include:
- **MOND_UNIT** is a REQUIRED field (:ref:`Rule 10b <ags4_rule_10b>`) which enforces the inclusion of units for all monitoring point readings in the data file. Where a reading has no unit, the **MOND_UNIT** data shall be set to "-" to clearly state this fact.
- Units included in **MOND_UNIT** must be fully defined in the :ref:`UNIT <ags4_group_UNIT>` group (:ref:`Rule 15 <ags4_rule_15>`). It is possible that units require conversion when the data is received and amalgamated into project databases to ensure that data are consistent across monitoring tranches and appropriate for the assessment.
- Where an instrument records more than one parameter with each reading, for example the three components for a survey total station, or the temperature and pressure then each reading has separate entry.
- Allowance has been made for recording peak and steady gas concentrations which are a requirement of the SISG specification and CIRIA C665 report.
- If an incident affects a particular instrument or a particular data reading in a single instrument then it is best reported as a remark in **MOND_REM** on the date and time at which it occurred or was noted, and associated with the particular reading that is affected eg 'Installation vandalised. Cover damaged'.
- If there is an event on the site that is of a more general nature that may affect the results on a number of instruments then this can be reported in :ref:`PREM <ags4_group_PREM>` or :ref:`TREM <ags4_group_TREM>` as a time related remark.
