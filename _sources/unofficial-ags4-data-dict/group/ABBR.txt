Notes - 5
-------------------------
- **ABBR** is required in all AGS4 data files and describes all abbreviations used in headings defined by the PA data type (:ref:`Rule 16 <ags4_rule_16>`).
- The **ABBR** and CODE groups in AGS3 have been consolidated into a single listing.
- The AGS Format website (www.ags.org.uk) lists the standard abbreviations.
- Additional abbreviations, used in any heading in the file, must be defined in this group.
- **ABBR_LIST** details the list from which the **ABBR_CODE** originates. For standard AGS headings this value would be ?AGS4? to refer to the AGS website.
