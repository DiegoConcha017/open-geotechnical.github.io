-------------------------
- **STND** may be used to state a list of standards, specifications and other reference documents that define the methods to which data has been collected and reported. For example, EN ISO 14688 - 1 (Section 6) and EN ISO 14689 - 1 (Section 5) describes that it should be clearly stated that the descriptions are based on visual and manual identification.
- Information on the scope of the data collected to each standard is included in STND_SCPE.
