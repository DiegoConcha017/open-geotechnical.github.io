Notes - 3
-------------------------
- **DCPG** and :ref:`DCPT <ags4_group_DCPT>` are used together to record dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) tests.
- **DCPG_REM** should be used to record test set up including surface type, surface condition, base type, thickness of base (if removed) mm (ref TRL Project PR/INT/277/04).
- It is suggested that if CBR values derived from DCP tests are to be transferred in the AGS data then these should be included in the :ref:`ICBR <ags4_group_ICBR>` group.
