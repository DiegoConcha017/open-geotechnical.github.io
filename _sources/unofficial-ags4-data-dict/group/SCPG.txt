Notes - 7
-------------------------
- SCPG is used to record the general information about static cone penetration tests.
- Pressuremeter tests using CPT equipment (eg cone or driven pressuremeter) should be recorded in the PMTG and associated groups.
- SCPG_FILT and SCPG_FRIC are included as they are reporting requirements of BS1377.
- SCPG_WATA is required to clarify origin of water level recorded in SCPG_WAT.
- SCPG_REM is used to transfer comments on the test and any interpretated parameters. SCPG_REM may refer to the STND group where full information on standards and references could be provided.
- CPT testing is frequently carried out by specialist sub-contractors. SCPG_CONT is included to record name of specialist sub-contractor.
- SCPG_CAR and SCPG_SLAR are included to transfer information used to calculate qt and ft.
