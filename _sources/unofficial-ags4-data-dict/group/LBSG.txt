Notes - 4
-------------------------
- The **LBSG** group is used to describe the testing schedules generated on a project.
- This group, together with :ref:`LBST <ags4_group_LBST>` (test details), would typically be used in data files that are transferred as part of the investigation and testing process. These groups would not necessarily be included in a data file that represented final reporting data.
- A data row in this group represents the issue of a schedule to a laboratory to testing organisation.
- Any general requirements for the test schedule, for example, dates for completion, contact details, should be included in this group. Details of the test required are provided in the :ref:`LBST <ags4_group_LBST>` group against the samples.
