Notes - 3
-------------------------
- **IPID** is used to record the results of on site volatile testing by means of headspace analysis using photo ionisation detectors.
- **IPID_CRED** added to permit details of any test accreditation if appropriate to be included in data.
- Clause 7.9.8 of the updated SISG Specification advises ambient weather and temperature to be recorded at time of test. **IPID_ENV** and **IPID_TEMP** added to include this information.
