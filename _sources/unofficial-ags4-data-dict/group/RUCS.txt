Notes - 2
-------------------------
- Note that units and accuracy for UCS are not prescribed in ISRM and the conventional MPa to 3SF is adopted here. ISRM defines GPa to 3SF for Young?s modulus and as such this is also adopted. ISRM suggests 3 significant figures for Poisson?s ratio but conventionally this is reported to 2 decimal places and this has been adopted.
- ISRM specifies stress rate MPa/s but most tests are performed at a rate of loading kN/s or kN/min, and sometimes under strain controlled conditions for deformability. The results should always be converted and reported as MPa/s where necessary.
