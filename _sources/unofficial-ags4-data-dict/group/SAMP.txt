Notes - 11
-------------------------
- The **SAMP** group is used to record all samples; eg those taken during field sampling or monitoring or sub-samples created in the laboratory.
- **SAMP_ID** has been added to the sample key set. Unique sample identifiers can be used to enhance the process of reintegration of testing results from subcontract laboratories and/or used to contain barcode or pre-made label references.  The addition of the **SAMP_ID** heading into the **SAMP** group provides greater flexibility for accommodating different process methodologies. A full explanation of example uses of **SAMP_ID** are given in on the AGS website.
- **SAMP_ID** does not have to be used and can be NULL (:ref:`Rule 12 <ags4_rule_12>`).  The remaining descriptive key/label headings can be used on their own.
- **SAMP_LINK** has been added to permit the source of samples to be fully detailed. The **SAMP_LINK** field is a Record Link (RL) format as defined in :ref:`Rule 11 <ags4_rule_11>` and accompanying Note v.
- In selecting abbreviations for use in SAMP_TYPE, allowance should be made for use of additional codification or suffixes to standard abbreviations to reflect the sample types and collection methods applying to measurement / payment purposes.
- **SAMP_PREP** allow details of the sample preparation to be included. This would typically be used to detail the precautions taken with samples for further chemical or environmental testing.
- **SAMP_LOG** and **SAMP_DESD** allow inclusion of the name of the person describing the sample and date this was carried out as required in ISO 14688-1, Section 6 and EN ISO 14689-1, Section 5.
- **SAMP_COND** has been included to provide for any comments on condition, representativeness and reliability of the sample which are requirements of EN ISO 14688-1 (Section 6) and BS 5930 respectively.  This heading together with the sample recovery **SAMP_RECV** provide useful data to those specifying laboratory scheduling. Data included if not 100%.
- The requirement of EN ISO 14688-1 (Section 6) and EN ISO 14689-1 (Section 5) to record the details of origin, collection and handling of samples are included in the associated groups.
- **SAMP_ETIM** and **SAMP_DURN** allow for data that describes the duration of sampling event if that is required. This can be important in environmental sampling applications.
- **SAMP_CAPT** provides for description of sample composition in the case of an amalgamated sample.
