Notes - 4
-------------------------
- **HDPH** is used to record information regarding exploratory hole construction. The **HDPH** group subdivides the hole development by depth such that the differing methods used to advance a hole or pit (or holes developed using combined methods) are explicitly described As a minimum, one record will exist in **HDPH** for each record in the :ref:`LOCA <ags4_group_LOCA>` group if the AGS file is transferring hole construction details.
- Records of orientation and inclination of the exploratory hole should be included in the :ref:`HORN <ags4_group_HORN>` group.
- Records in **HDPH** should be continuous and non-overlapping.
- **HDPH_LOG** and **HDPH_LOGD** have been added to include the name of the person describing the strata in this section of the exploratory hole and date as required in ISO 14688-1 (Section 6) and EN ISO 14689-1 (Section 5). It is not deemed necessary to detail this information further for example in the :ref:`GEOL <ags4_group_GEOL>` group.
