Notes - 2
-------------------------
- The data reported from total and effective stress testing is different therefore TREG and TRET has been added for the reporting of effective stress testing.
- Standard testing methods normally report the Cu value against each test specimen and defer from providing an assessed Cu value for a set of specimens from a sample. This data is therefore included in the TRIT group.
