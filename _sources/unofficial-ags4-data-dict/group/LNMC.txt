Notes - 2
-------------------------
- This group should be retained for moisture content tests (usually synonymous with ?as received?) carried out as individual or separate tests. Where a moisture content is measured as part of another test (eg a triaxial test), the moisture content should be transferred in that group under the appropriate heading.
- Moisture content corrected for material >425um and fluid content are not included as automatic headings. Apart from being very rarely used (in the UK), these are usually dependent upon assumptions about representativity, moisture content retention in coarse material or salt content in pore water.  It is better left to the recipient of the data to interpret these other parameters which are not specified requirements of moisture content (or index) standards. It could be argued that if fluid content were to be included here, it should also be in all tests with moisture content.
