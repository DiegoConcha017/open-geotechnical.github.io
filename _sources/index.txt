Open GeoTechnical
=============================================

The idea is to this `project` focus on geotechnical enginnering and data interpolation

- create a bunch of code within this

Open Source Software and Stuff for GeoTechnical Enigneering and Data Exchange,
and everyone nibbling sandwiched as part of the food chain

Your experience and opinion is valued, 
please realise that whatever level u think your at ;-)

.. note:: 

    Mission statement is crazy creating a website and code for 
    
    - geotechnical egnineer + a hacker whie gets scripting + a www
    - Wanna blog 
    - new developers and vice versa

    
    And a mad idea toward a cool environment where
    
    - GeoTehnical engineer is happy
    - with developer beside and system
    - Each domain and protocol inbetween done and dusted
    - Almost, cos we utlitamtely need GPS..
        - and then convince manager its a good idea to goto 
        - california for some bearing retio of beaches and valleys
        - and the imperiral measurements (Mr Donald) report into SI
    
    If you have a mad idea, or a project manager then please raise an issue
    
    

.. warning:: 

    Mission kinda statement is that this is work in progress on creating a website and code for 
    GeoTechnical engineers along with new developers and vice versa
