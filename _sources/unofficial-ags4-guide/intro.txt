AGS4 Quickstart
=============================

.. note::
    
    - This is a quick guide intended for **new developers** to the wonderdul land of the ags4 file format
    - Its unofficial but intended to make one a master of the ags4 art
    
Whats is AGS4 ?
----------------------------

`AGS4` is a standard for data exchange in GeoTechnical Engineering, and compises of two part:

- The **text file format** for sharing data between companies/projects 
  - for machine 2 machine exchange 
  
- And a **data dictionary** used for the exchange of GeoTechnical data 
  - for GeoTechnical engineer stuff

Its design and dark roots are in spreasheets on olde msdos pre 16bit color screen from yonder years
- so there's a bunch of bald/grey heads on AGS Comittee Team
- and agreed was a way to share and serialise spreadsheet data, without sharing spreadsheet database et all itself
- Think multiple spreadsheets tabs and a csv of each tab
- And as well as then, agreed to use the same column names and its data types
- Amazing feat, and its getting even more popular :-)


What does it smell like ?
------------------------------

The simple example below shows two groups, although on a real file there would be many more

- the `Project Info` (PROJ) group, with one row of data
- the `Location / Test Points` (LOCA) group with three rows

.. code::

    "GROUP","PROJ"
    "HEADING","PROJ_ID","PROJ_ID","PROJ_ID","PROJ_CLNT"
    "UNIT","","","",""
    "TYPE","ID","X","X","X"
    "DATA","Prj-AG","Acme Gasworks","Greenwich, London","Acme Enterprises"

    "GROUP","LOCA"
    "HEADING","LOCA_ID","LOCA_TYPE","LOCA_NATE","LOCA_NATN","LOCA_GL","LOCA_FDEP"
    "UNIT","","","m","m","m","m"
    "TYPE","ID","PA","0DP","0DP","2DP","1DP"
    "DATA","TP1","RO","539277","179635","-20.35","3.5"
    "DATA","TP2","RO","539245","179456","-23.35","2.1"
    "DATA","TP3","RO","539299","179474","-20.22","2.9"

.. note:: 
    
    - Looks like :ref:`csv`, but unlike a **true csv**, its not equal column length down the rows which is why most builtin csv parsers can handle it.
    - A developers tip is to read each line, and get native parser to parse each line
    - Or read each group block into a string/file and then parse equal cols
    

What does it all mean ?
-------------------------------

The first column are the :term:`DATA DESCRIPTORS`, and basically describe what the row's data means:

    - **GROUP** - indicates a new group (spreadsheet tab)
    - **HEADING** - the column headings for this group (column in a tab)
    - **UNIT** - the units for the columns, is there is one 
    - **TYPE** - the column type, eg `X` for text or `2DP` for two decimal places (the column formatting)
    - **DATA** - one or more data rows conforming to the **TYPE** (the lines of data after fixed header)
    - The HEADING, UNIT and TYPE are coolectively called the HEADER and define the column ? (to check)
    
Mysterious codes ?
-------------------------------------------

The `codes` are defined, maintained and published by the AGS (here), and 
called the **AGS4 Data Dictionary**. 

The data dictionary comprises a few parts and are pretty fixed to mean some things. This is
one of the strength og ags in data interchange (see validator soon):

- The list of four digit **GROUP** codes
    - eg `PROJ` for project details, `SAMP` for sample information
    
- The **HEADING** codes which always start with the group code
    - eg `SAMP_REF`, `SAMP_ID`, `SAMP_TYPE`
    
- A list of registered **UNIT** eg 
    - `km2` for `square kilometre`
    - `lbf` for `pounds force`  

- A **TYPE** which defined the format/type of data, eg
    - `2DP` for 2 decimal points
    - `X`
    - `DT` for a date time type
    - Important is `PA` for :ref:`abbrs` (abbreviations)
    
- **ABBR** (Abbreviations) for various **HEADINGS**
    - The **TYPE** PA means pick abbreviation eg
      - `B` for a Bulk Sample in SAMP_TYPE
      - `PRELIM` for a Relim in LOCA_STAT
      


How do I use it ?
